Visual Argument Proposal
The main purpose of my visual argument is to communicate the effect that the layering of perspectives has; essentially, that everything you perceive is altered (at least slightly) by your own points of view, that come from various parts of your identity, and that that is also true for everyone else. Thus, you should try to go back to the source of whatever you’re looking at, or at least consider other perspectives, as anything you’re seeing from anyone could be a heavily filtered product, having gone through many different people’s own lenses. This will be seen explicitly as there will be a focal point within the original argument that would have a clear identity/purpose in a vacuum, but because of various lenses layered on top of it, becomes obscured and wholly different in the end product. The thinking mentioned earlier will be prompted by the text on the image itself (“what do you see?”), which already prompts the viewer to think more critically about what they’re looking at, along with the fact that the word “see” will be in magenta, a color entirely fabricated by our own eyes, to drive home the point that what you’re seeing may not represent a whole “truth.”
